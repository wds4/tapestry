# Profile (npub) search

WoT scores will come from Brainstorm (NIP-85 kind 30382 events).

Competition: 
- https://npub.world, where trust scores come from personalizedPageRank via Vertex WoT API
- https://profilestr.com/?search=odell, which has a trust score -- not sure how calculated? not sure if profiles are ordered by that or by follower count


### Search page
- order results by GrapeRank
- a variety of "perspectives" will be offered: global, npubA, npubB, etc (with button to "get your own perspective" which will take them to the brainstorm signup page)

A variety of visual cues will be used to communicate Grapevine scores: background color and thickness, border color and thickness, opacity, font weights.
- Border: Verified or not. ("good" signal.) Green, with intensity and thickness proportional to GrapeRank score. White border indicates unverified (low or zero GrapeRank.). Low GrapeRank scores approach "invisibility". Opacity of picture also proportional to GrapeRank score.
- Background: Reported (red), muted (black), or both. ("bad" signal.)

Combination of good and bad: border is bad, background is good color
- Verified but Reported or Muted: Green background, Red or Black border
