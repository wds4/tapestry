# Additional Troubleshooting

## Cannot log in to neo4j browser via web UI

If login fails at the neo4j web ui (http://<your-url>:7474), try using `neo4j` as both the username and password.  
If that doesn't work, try this:

- Edit (probably with sudo) `/etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf`
  - Find the commented out line `# dmbs.security.auth_enabled=false`
  - Uncomment it. Leave it `false`
- `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
- `sudo systemctl restart neo4j`
` sudo cypher-shell -u neo4j`
  - (Note: in when dbms auth is enabled, you'll need to enter your neo4j password after the sudo password. for now you shouldn't be prompted for that since it's temporarily disabled in the .conf)
  - At this shell, enter: `ALTER USER neo4j SET PASSWORD 'mynewpasswordhere';`
  - Then: `:exit` (note the colon)
- Back in `/etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf`...
  - `# dmbs.security.auth_enabled=false` comment this back out.
- `sudo systemctl restart neo4j`
- Edit `/etc/brainstorm.conf`, find the `export NEO4J_PASSWORD=` line and update it to whatever you set above.
- Save this file. No need to restart anything.
- Try to login again
